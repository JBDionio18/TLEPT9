<p align= "justified"><font color=white face= "Courier New">“Another batch of people tested positive in Covid-19…”, these words could hunt every person all around the world. We wouldn’t know that a single microorganism could vanish millions of people here on Earth.
<br>A virus has spread, causing a crisis to our globe. An infectious disease called the "Corona Virus", has greatly affected the world in terms of economics and health. It has also caused a social disruption that has made a radical alteration and a breakdown in social life. It became the reason why many food chains are broken, resulting in a mass extinction, demolishing life on Earth. Many suffered, many cried in sorrow, many holds onto their faith; many didn’t give up to the thought that someday the Earth would again be filled with smiles and laughter.

<br> The year 2021 started hopeful to everyone, knowing the fact that various countries are doing their best to find a solution to this Pandemic which already lasted for a year. Vaccines that could probably cure or prevent a person from being infected in Corona Virus are evidently multiplying. Unfortunately, we cannot depend our lives to a single vaccine especially if it isn't proven accurate yet. In the end, it is still our faith which could lift us up in times that we feel like giving up.</p align></font>
